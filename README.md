# Deploy static website to S3 using Github action
## There are some steps are follow for this application.
# Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket
1. Sign in to AWS Management Console and open the S3 service.

2. Create a new S3 bucket:

3. Click on "Create bucket".
 - Enter a unique bucket name (e.g., my-static-website).
 - Choose the region closest to your audience.
 - Uncheck "Block all public access" to allow public access to the bucket.
 - Acknowledge the warning and proceed.

4. Configure Bucket for Static Website Hosting:
 - After creating the bucket, go to the Properties tab.
 - Scroll down to the "Static website hosting" section.
 - Enable static website hosting and specify the index document (e.g., index.html).

5. Set Bucket Policy to Make Content Public:

 - Go to the Permissions tab, then scroll to the "Bucket policy" section.
 - edit a bucket policy to allow public read access to the contents. "Replace your-bucket-name" with your "actual bucket name:"

 - Save the policy.
   
# Step 2: Push Your Static Website to GitHub
1. Initialize a Git Repository:

In your local project directory, run these command.
 - git init
 - git add .
 - git commit -m "type commit message"

2. Create a GitHub Repository:

Go to GitHub and create a new repository (e.g., my-static-website).
Push your local repository to GitHub, using these command,
  - git remote add origin https://github.com/Abdu12l34/my-static-website.git
  - git branch -M main
  - git push -u origin main

# Step 3: Automate Deployment with GitHub Actions
  1. Create a GitHub Actions Workflow:

     - In your project, create a directory named .github/workflows.

     - Inside it, create a file named deploy.yml with the following content:
       
name: Deploy to S3

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Sync S3 bucket
      uses: jakejarvis/s3-sync-action@v1
      with:
        args: --delete --acl public-read
      env:
        AWS_S3_BUCKET: ${{ secrets.AWS_S3_BUCKET }}
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        AWS_REGION: 'us-east-1'
        SOURCE_DIR: 'website'
- this code paste in deploy.yml file
- Replace your-region with your AWS region (e.g., ap-shout-1), and "your-bucket-name" with your S3 bucket name.
   
 2. Add AWS Credentials to GitHub Secrets:

 - Go to your GitHub repository, click on "Settings," then "Secrets and variables," and finally "Actions."
 - Click on "New repository secret" and add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY with your AWS IAM user credentials that have S3 access.        

# Step 4: Push Changes to GitHub
Commit and push your workflow file to the main branch:

 - git add .
 - git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for S3 deployment"
 - git push origin main
   
# Step 5: Access Your Static Website
 - After pushing, GitHub Actions will automatically deploy your site to S3. You can access your static website via the S3 bucket URL (e.g., http://your-bucket-name.s3-website.your-region.amazonaws.com).
